# trove

> **Status: scaffold (v0.0.0).** Runtime shell only. No scanners, no storage,
> no keystore reads. See spec for the v1 surface.

`trove` is the inventory tool from the Rafter 2.0 Secret Management project — a
read-only, annotate-only auditor for secrets that already live in plaintext on
your machine (`.env*` files, shell rc, agent configs, OS keystores, and source
code via betterleaks).

## What's landed so far

A single Go binary that:

- Binds an HTTP server to `127.0.0.1` on a random port
- Mints a per-session token, embeds it in the launcher URL
- Auto-opens the default browser to that URL
- Sets a strict, HttpOnly session cookie on first hit and strips the token
  from the URL so it doesn't linger in history
- Runs while the tab is open; exits on the close beacon or after the idle
  timeout with no heartbeat
- Serves a placeholder index page + `/api/status`

Plus the storage and fingerprint internals the rest of v1 builds on:

- `internal/storage`: typed schema for the `~/.config/trove/global.json`
  document, atomic `Save` (temp-file + fsync + rename, mode `0600`), `Load`
  with first-run-as-empty semantics, XDG-aware default path, plus
  `Upsert` / `MarkStale` / `MarkRotated` (fingerprint-based dedup, drift
  records value rotations to `value_history`, annotations survive drift)
- `internal/fingerprint`: `BLAKE3(key_name + 0x00 + value)` cross-source
  dedup ids and the rune-safe `value_preview` formatter
- `internal/scanners/file`, `internal/scanners/config`,
  `internal/scanners/shellrc`: read-only parsers for the v1 file
  surfaces — dotenv files, AWS shared credentials, npmrc auth tokens,
  docker config, gh hosts.yml, Claude settings, and shell rc files.
  Every scanner opens `O_RDONLY`, captures the file's mode in
  `FoundIn.Permissions`, and never writes/renames/deletes the source.
- `internal/scan`: filesystem walk that honours configured roots and
  excludes (with `**/X/`, `~/X/`, and basename rules), follows symlinks
  INTO scan roots only (never out), and detects ancestor cycles.
  Dispatches recognised paths to the matching scanner and folds
  observations into the global store via `Upsert`. Scans are
  zero-mutation by construction.
- `internal/wizard`: first-run prompt that seeds `ScanConfig.Roots`
  with `$HOME` (plus any detected `~/code`, `~/git`, … layouts) and
  pre-loads the spec's default exclude list.

A `--rescan` flag on `trove` triggers a non-interactive scan and
persists the updated store. The first-run wizard fires automatically
on launch when `ScanConfig.Roots` is empty.

- `internal/watch`: fsnotify-backed drift watcher. Registers every
  directory under each scan root, debounces fs events into a single
  rescan trigger, and picks up new subdirectories as they appear.
  The trove store directory is excluded so the save-after-scan write
  doesn't loop the watcher.
- `internal/eventbus`: in-process pub/sub broker for drift signals.
  Slow subscribers have events dropped rather than blocking the
  publisher, so a stalled browser tab can't stall the rescanner.
- `internal/rescan`: glues the above together — the watcher's
  debounced trigger fires a `scan.Run`, per-secret outcomes are
  published to the bus, and the doc is persisted before
  `scan_complete`.
- `/api/events`: server-sent-events stream over the trove HTTP
  surface. Clients connect with the existing session token, receive
  `scan_started`, `secret_created`, `secret_refreshed`,
  `secret_drifted`, and `scan_complete` frames as they happen.
- `internal/docstore`: a single-mutex wrapper around the on-disk
  `*storage.Global` that the rescanner and the HTTP handlers share.
  Every doc mutation (scanner upserts, annotations, mark-stale,
  mark-rotated) goes through the same lock, so a click in the UI
  during a rescan blocks briefly rather than racing the scanner.
- `internal/server/secrets.go`: `GET /api/secrets` returns the live
  inventory; `POST /api/secrets/{id}/reveal` reads the value from
  disk on demand (via `scan.ResolveValue`), `PUT /api/secrets/{id}/annotation`
  edits the user metadata, and `POST /api/secrets/{id}/{stale,rotated}`
  expose the two action buttons from the spec. Keystore and source-code
  reveals return 422 (not yet supported).
- `internal/server/static/`: the embedded inventory UI. List grouped
  by source, side panel for annotation, click-to-reveal for plaintext
  sources, debounced auto-save on annotation edits, live SSE updates
  when the drift watcher fires.

The keystore reader lands in subsequent commits.

## Hard rules (carried in from the spec)

- **Zero mutations to `.env` files in any code path.** Ever. The audit surface
  is read + annotate only.
- Never bind to `0.0.0.0`. Never reuse a port. Never log the session token.
- Keystore-read code must NOT land before the `rafter-secure-design` walk
  (see bead **rc-4fc**).
- Source-code scan must NOT land before betterleaks lands in raftercli (bead
  **rc-ksy**).

The zero-mutation rule has two enforcement layers — both must stay green:

- `scripts/no-write-syscalls.sh` is the **static** lint. It rejects banned
  write symbols (`os.WriteFile`, `os.Remove`, `os.Rename`, etc.) inside the
  read-only packages: `internal/scanners`, `internal/scan`, `internal/watch`,
  `internal/rescan`. `os.OpenFile` is allowed only when paired with
  `os.O_RDONLY` on the same line. Run from `inventory-tool/`:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/no-write-syscalls.sh
  ```
- `tests/invariant/` is the **runtime** safety net. It builds a synthetic
  fixture of `.env`, `.env.production`, `.npmrc`, `.zshrc`, and
  `.aws/credentials`, takes a SHA-256 manifest of the tree, drives the full
  HTTP API and the real fsnotify-backed rescan pipeline against it, and
  asserts the manifest is byte-identical afterwards (apart from any mutation
  the test itself performs). A second test attaches an independent fsnotify
  watcher to the fixture and asserts trove generates **zero** write events
  there. A third fuzzes random JSON bodies at every PATCH/POST endpoint and
  asserts the fixture is still untouched.
  ```bash
  go test ./tests/invariant/...
  ```

`.github-trove-lint.yml` is the staged GitHub Actions workflow that wires
both layers into CI; P7 promotes it to `.github/workflows/`.
